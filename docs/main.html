        <h2>Who is this guy?</h2>
        <p>
            I am a computer science student at Santa Clara University with strong foundations in Python/C++/Java with an interest in applying machine learning in
            robotics, automation, and motorsport applications to solve real world problems. My expertise includes working with object
            oriented languages using frameworks, like ROS and Ruby on Rails, to conduct motion planning and full stack web
            development. Additionally, I am well versed with hands-on work such as prototyping robots using 3D printing, building high
            voltage electrical test equipment, and repairing automotive engines. I am a fast learner and thrive in collaborative team
            environments. I enjoy taking on new challenges and solving complex problems.

                <p>
                    Biznify is a website that helps prospective small business owners find the ideal place to setup shop. This website was implemented by
                    my team of two and I for the annual Inrix Hackathon in just under 24 hours and earned top 6 projects out of 43 competitors. Our app queries
                    data from Datafiniti on retail space available for rent based on a location that the user enters. We then use tranportation data from Inrix to
                    rank the results based on parking availability and trips to a specified location, with the option to add more data in the future if we were to deploy
                    this as a service. I used the Google Maps API to render the front end maps display for the recommended locations.

                <img src="./assets/dingo.jpg" alt="robot-dog">
                <p>
                    The aim of PACRR is to create a low cost, autonomous capable quadruped robot for first responder applications 
                    like search and rescue, detecting gas leaks, and other situations where it is dangerous or too confined for humans. 
                    We are starting with an open source design for a 3D printed robot dog, then modifying it to be better suited for 
                    rugged and unsafe applications.  Companies like Boston Dynamics have demonstrated that quadruped robots are not simply 
                    novelty but have actual life-saving capabilities in dangerous situations during their partnership with the New York 
                    Fire Department. However, these robots are nearly $75,000, which is far out of the budget for smaller fire departments 
                    and other disaster relief organizations. Our design will be cheaper, simpler, and more expendable, allowing even small 
                    organizations to use it.

                <p>
                    This was my final project for ELEN 131 - intro to robotics - at SCU. I collaborated with a team of 3 to develop a game application for the 
                    Franka Emika Panda Robot, simulating a checkerboard and pieces deploying the Move-It Python library. I was responsible for designing the gameplay scene, 
                    enabling the robot to interact with virtual game elements. Additionally I implemented a tf2 path planning algorithm for calculating trajectories and executing 
                    gameplay using the ROS Python framework.
